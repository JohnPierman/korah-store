# Korah Store
Welcome to the Repository for the Korah Store technology. This is the place to find the code which powers the Raspberry Pi systems, which in turn power the monitors and other aspects of our system. If you would like to commit, or ask about files, please contact John Pierman at Korah C&VS.
